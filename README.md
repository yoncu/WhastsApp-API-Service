# WhastsApp-API-Service

Service Details: https://www.yoncu.com/whatsapp

**WhatsApp Enterprise REST API Service**
When the WhatsApp Business API service is activated by Yöncü Bilişim Çözümleri, a QR Code appears on your panel for verification, access is activated by scanning the QR Code from the connected devices menu in the WhatsApp Business application on your phone. Until you terminate the connected device, the WhatsApp Business API service of Yoncu Information Solutions can be used. When the device is added by reading the QR Code, all the conversations in the WhatsApp application are transferred to the web / API environment and deleted on the phone. You cannot see the messages on the phone when the service is active, as the service will delete them from the phone as soon as the message comes to the phone when using the Yoncu IT Solutions WhatsApp Business API service. Callback API can be used for messages. Callback API allows incoming messages to be posted as JSON to a URL address you specify. Triggered when message arrives, user can't start it.

**Installation and Activity:**
You can enter WhatsApp Web access by typing the WhatsApp Service ID information that will be provided to you after the purchase in the SERVICEID field of each field in the links below. You can start the service on the page that opens when you log in. When the service starts, you should read the QR Code that will appear on the screen by entering the device add menu from the WhatsApp application on your phone. When you read the QR Code, the service will transfer your incoming messages to the Web Environment and delete them from the phone. Web and API services can be used after all incoming messages have been transferred to the web and deleted from the phone.
